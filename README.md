Script mode is where you put a bunch of commands into a file (a script), and then tell Python to run the file. Answer: The main difference between the two modes is that Script mode runs your commands sequentially, while interactive mode runs them as they are typed.
# Taking two variables from user.
a = int(input("Enter a number of integer value: "))
b = int(input("Enter second integer number: "))
# Addition of two input variables.
c = a + b.
# Printing addition result in the output.
print("The addition of two numbers given by you is: ", c)
